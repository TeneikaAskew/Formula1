# Pit Stop Data Analysis: F1DB vs Jolpica

## Data Source Comparison

### 1. F1DB Pit Stops Data (`/data/f1db/races-pit-stops.csv`)

**Structure:**
- `raceId`: Unique race identifier
- `year`, `round`: Season and race number
- `driverId`: Driver identifier
- `stop`: Pit stop number (1, 2, 3, etc.)
- `lap`: Lap number when pit stop occurred
- `time`: Duration of pit stop in seconds (format: "23.859")
- `timeMillis`: Duration in milliseconds

**Key Characteristics:**
- Contains ONLY pit stop duration (time spent in pit lane)
- Does NOT contain elapsed race time to pit stop
- Provides lap number when stop occurred
- Multiple stops per driver tracked

**Example:**
```
Driver: isack-hadjar
Stop 1: Lap 2, Duration: 21.297 seconds
Stop 2: Lap 28, Duration: 21.680 seconds
```

### 2. Jolpica Laps Data (`/data/jolpica/laps/`)

**Structure:**
- JSON format with lap-by-lap timing data
- Each lap contains all drivers' lap times
- `time`: Individual lap time (format: "1:22.568")
- No pit stop indicators in the data

**Key Characteristics:**
- Contains individual lap times for each driver
- Can calculate cumulative race time by summing lap times
- Does NOT indicate when pit stops occur
- Would need to infer pit stops from unusually slow lap times

**Example:**
```json
Lap 1: norris - 1:57.099
Lap 2: norris - 1:19.857
```

## Analysis for "Time to First Pit Stop" Calculation

### What PrizePicks Needs:
- Elapsed race time from start until driver enters pit lane
- Example: If a driver pits on lap 20 after 25 minutes of racing

### Challenge with Both Sources:

**F1DB Limitations:**
- Only has pit stop duration and lap number
- Missing cumulative race time to reach pit entry
- Would need lap times to calculate elapsed time

**Jolpica Limitations:**
- Has lap times but no pit stop indicators
- Would need to guess pit stops from slow laps
- Unreliable for precise pit stop timing

## Recommendation: NEITHER SOURCE IS SUFFICIENT

**Why:**
1. **F1DB** tells us WHEN (lap number) and HOW LONG (duration) but not elapsed race time
2. **Jolpica** gives lap times but doesn't identify pit stops

**What's Needed:**
To calculate "time to first pit stop" for PrizePicks betting, we need:
1. Cumulative race time data (sum of all laps before pit stop)
2. Clear pit stop indicators
3. Ideally: sector times to know exact pit entry moment

**Potential Solution:**
Combine both sources:
1. Use F1DB to identify pit stop lap numbers
2. Use Jolpica to sum lap times up to pit stop lap
3. This would give approximate elapsed time to first pit stop

**Accuracy Issues:**
- Pit stop lap in Jolpica includes in-lap (partial racing + pit lane)
- Can't separate racing time from pit lane time in that lap
- Result would be 30-60 seconds off actual pit entry time

## Conclusion

Neither data source alone provides accurate "time to first pit stop" data needed for PrizePicks betting. A combined approach would give estimates but with significant margin of error. For accurate betting data, you would need:
- Official F1 timing data with sector times
- Telemetry data showing pit lane entry
- Or specialized data sources that track cumulative race time to pit entry
