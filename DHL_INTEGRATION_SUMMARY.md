# DHL Pit Stop Data Integration Summary

## Overview
Successfully integrated official DHL pit stop data into the F1 performance analysis pipeline. The integration includes automated data loading, driver matching, and comprehensive analysis with yearly views.

## What Was Added

### 1. DHL Data Loader (`F1PerformanceAnalyzer._load_dhl_data()`)
- Automatically finds and loads the latest DHL CSV file from `/data/dhl/`
- Handles multiple possible data directory locations
- Ensures consistent column naming for integration

### 2. DHL Pit Stop Analysis (`F1PerformanceAnalyzer.analyze_dhl_pit_stops()`)
- **Metrics calculated**: 
  - `avg_time`: Average pit stop time in seconds
  - `median_time`: Median pit stop time in seconds  
  - `best_time`: Fastest pit stop time in seconds
  - `best_time_lap`: Lap number where best time occurred
  - `total_stops`: Total number of pit stops recorded

- **Driver Matching**: Intelligent mapping from DHL driver names to F1 database driver IDs
- **Yearly Analysis**: Breakdown by year for multi-year data trends
- **Current Season Filtering**: Only shows active drivers

### 3. Performance Analysis Integration (Section 3b)
- Added as subsection after existing pit stop analysis (Section 3)
- **Main Table**: Shows all drivers sorted by average time (fastest first)
- **Yearly View**: Matrix format showing performance across years
- **Format**: `Avg  Med  Best  Stops` for each year
- **Fallback**: Single year view when only one year of data available

### 4. Pipeline Integration
- No changes needed to existing pipeline files
- `F1PerformanceAnalyzer` automatically loads DHL data on initialization
- Results included in performance tables output dictionary as `'dhl_pit_stops'`

## Usage

### Running the Complete Pipeline
```bash
# Standard pipeline run (includes DHL data automatically)
python notebooks/advanced/run_f1_pipeline.py

# The DHL section will appear as "3b. DHL OFFICIAL PIT STOP TIMES BY DRIVER"
```

### Testing DHL Integration
```bash
# Test DHL integration specifically
python test_dhl_integration.py

# First run DHL scraper if no data exists
python dhl_current_season_scraper.py
```

### Updating DHL Data
```bash
# Manual update (only fetches new races)
python dhl_current_season_scraper.py

# GitHub Action runs automatically every Thursday at 6 AM UTC
```

## Expected Output Format

### Main DHL Table
```
3b. DHL OFFICIAL PIT STOP TIMES BY DRIVER (seconds)

## Data Sources
- **DHL Data**: Official DHL fastest pit stop competition results from https://inmotion.dhl/en/formula-1/fastest-pit-stop-award
- **F1 Database**: Standard F1 database for driver matching and race information
- **Automated Updates**: GitHub Action scrapes new race data weekly

## Technical Notes
- **Driver Matching**: Maps DHL driver names to F1 database using multiple name formats (full name, surname, driver code)
- **Data Validation**: Filters out entries without valid driver matches
- **Performance**: Minimal impact on pipeline execution time
- **Fallbacks**: Gracefully handles missing DHL data (shows "No DHL pit stop data available")

## Files Modified
1. `/workspace/notebooks/advanced/f1_performance_analysis.py`
   - Added `_load_dhl_data()` method
   - Added `analyze_dhl_pit_stops()` method  
   - Added Section 3b to `generate_all_tables()` output
   - Added `'dhl_pit_stops'` to results dictionary

2. `/workspace/.github/workflows/scrape-dhl-pitstops.yml`
   - Automated weekly data collection

3. `/workspace/test_dhl_integration.py`
   - Comprehensive test script for integration

## Benefits
- **Official Data**: Uses DHL's official fastest pit stop competition data
- **Comprehensive**: Covers all race weekends and drivers  
- **Historical**: Yearly comparison capabilities
- **Automated**: Self-updating via GitHub Actions
- **Integrated**: Seamlessly fits into existing performance analysis workflow

## Next Steps
After the first few races of 2025 are collected, the yearly comparison will become more meaningful. The system is ready to handle multi-year analysis as more data becomes available.
