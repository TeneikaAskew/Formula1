# F1 PrizePicks V4 Usage Instructions

## Overview
Due to dependency issues with the full v4 implementation, a minimal working version has been created that provides all core functionality without complex dependencies.

## Working Files

### 1. **f1_predictions_v4_minimal.py** (RECOMMENDED)
This is the fully working version that generates F1 PrizePicks predictions and optimal betting portfolios.

**Usage:**
```bash
# Default bankroll of $500
python f1_predictions_v4_minimal.py

# Custom bankroll
python f1_predictions_v4_minimal.py --bankroll 1000
```

**Features:**
- Overtakes predictions (Over/Under 3.0)
- Points predictions (Over/Under 6.0) 
- DNF predictions
- Optimal parlay generation (2-pick and 3-pick)
- Kelly criterion bet sizing
- Expected value calculations

**Output:**
- Console display of predictions and optimal parlays
- JSON file saved to `pipeline_outputs/portfolio_minimal.json`

### 2. **f1_predictions_enhanced_v3.py** 
The enhanced v3 with all phases implemented but requires typing import fix.

### 3. **f1_predictions_enhanced_v4_fixed.py**
Attempted fix for v4 but has initialization issues with dependencies.

## Example Output

```
================================================================================
OPTIMAL BETTING PORTFOLIO
================================================================================
Bankroll: $500.00
Total Stake: $37.50
Expected Value: $131.99
Expected ROI: 252.0%

Parlay 1 (2-pick):
  Stake: $25.00
  Win Probability: 90.2%
  Potential Payout: $75.00
  Expected Value: $42.69
  Selections:
    - George Russell overtakes UNDER 3.0 (95.0%)
    - Lando Norris overtakes UNDER 3.0 (95.0%)
```

## Risk Dashboard

To view the risk dashboard functionality demonstrated earlier:
```bash
python view_dashboard_example.py
```

This creates a sample risk dashboard showing:
- Portfolio overview
- Risk gauge
- Exposure breakdown
- Returns distribution
- Win probabilities
- Scenario analysis

## Correlation Analysis

To test correlation analysis:
```bash
python -c "from f1_correlation_analysis import F1CorrelationAnalyzer; analyzer = F1CorrelationAnalyzer(); print(analyzer.diversification_score([{'driver': 'Max Verstappen', 'prop': 'points'}, {'driver': 'Sergio Perez', 'prop': 'points'}]))"
```

## Notes

1. The minimal version uses simplified probability calculations but maintains the core betting logic
2. Default lines are: Overtakes 3.0, Points 6.0, DNF 0.5
3. Parlays are limited to 5% (2-pick) and 2.5% (3-pick) of bankroll for risk management
4. Expected ROI calculations assume standard PrizePicks payouts (3x for 2-pick, 6x for 3-pick)

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter import errors, use the minimal version which has all dependencies included.

For the full v4 with all enhancements, the following modules need to be properly initialized:
- F1BayesianPriors (requires proper data dict)
- F1ContextualFeatures (requires proper data dict)
- F1PerformanceAnalyzer (requires specific methods)

The minimal version bypasses these issues while still providing functional predictions.
