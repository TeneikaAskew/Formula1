# Advanced F1 Notebooks

These notebooks contain production-ready solutions for real-world F1 predictive applications.

## ðŸ”„ F1DB Integration

These notebooks now support loading data from the official F1DB repository (https://github.com/f1db/f1db), which provides:
- Always up-to-date F1 data (updated after each race)
- Comprehensive datasets from 1950 to present
- Multiple format options (CSV, JSON, SQL)

See `F1DB_Data_Tutorial.ipynb` for details on using F1DB data.

## ðŸ“‹ Requirements

These notebooks require the base packages plus additional dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
```
