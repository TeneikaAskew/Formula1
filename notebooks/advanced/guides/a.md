# F1 PrizePicks Model - PRD Implementation Tracker

## Overview
This document tracks the implementation of fixes and enhancements based on the PRD for the F1 PrizePicks prediction model.

## Current Status: Phase 1 - Critical Bug Fixes ✅ COMPLETED

### Phase 1.1: Fix Points Probability Calculation ✅ COMPLETED
**Problem**: All drivers show 100% probability of scoring points (Over 0.5) regardless of historical performance.

**Root Cause**: The `dropna()` function was removing zeros (non-points finishes) along with NaN values, leaving only races where drivers scored points. This made every driver appear to have 100% points probability.

**Solution Implemented**:
- Changed to use `points_finish_rate` which correctly calculates scoring races / total races
- Fixed in both `f1_predictions_enhanced.py` and `f1_predictions_enhanced_v2.py`

**Result**: Points probabilities now match historical rates (e.g., 15% for Lance Stroll, 95% for George Russell)

### Phase 1.2: Implement Realistic DNF Model ✅ COMPLETED
**Problem**: 0% DNF probability for all drivers is unrealistic.

**Root Cause**: The code was looking for positionText = 'R', but F1DB uses 'DNF' for retirements.

**Solution Implemented**:
- Updated DNF detection to check for: ['DNF', 'DNS', 'DSQ', 'EX', 'NC']
- Now correctly identifies all non-finishes

**Result**: DNF rates now show realistic values (5-15% depending on driver/team)

### Phase 1.3: Add Probability Sanity Checks ✅ COMPLETED
**Solution Implemented**:
- Added `bound_probability()` function to limit all probabilities between 1% and 99%
- Applied to all probability calculations
- Prevents extreme 0% or 100% predictions

**Result**: No more extreme probability predictions

## Phase 2.1: Probability Calibration ✅ COMPLETED

### Implementation Details
- Created `f1_probability_calibration.py` module with:
  - `F1ProbabilityCalibrator` class
  - Isotonic regression calibration (prepared for future use)
  - Platt scaling calibration (prepared for future use)
  - Bayesian prior adjustment with Beta-Binomial conjugate priors
  - Cross-validation methods to avoid overfitting

- Created `f1_predictions_enhanced_v3.py` with integrated calibration:
  - Added `calibrate_probability()` method to apply Bayesian priors
  - All probabilities now adjusted with historical base rates:
    - Points: 45% base rate (realistic for average driver)
    - Overtakes: 65% for 3+ overtakes
    - DNF: 12% historical average
    - Starting Position: 50% calibrated to median
    - Pit Stops: 70% for 2+ stops
    - Teammate Overtakes: 50% (evenly matched)
  - Prior strength of 10.0 (equivalent to 10 historical observations)

### Results
- Probabilities are now better calibrated away from extremes
- Bayesian priors shrink unrealistic predictions toward historical means
- Small sample sizes now produce more conservative predictions

## Phase 2.2: Bayesian Priors ✅ COMPLETED

### Implementation Details
- Created `f1_bayesian_priors.py` module with hierarchical Bayesian framework:
  - **Team-specific priors**: Based on constructor performance
    - Points scoring rates by team
    - DNF rates by constructor reliability
  - **Track-specific priors**: Circuit characteristics
    - Overtaking opportunities (Monaco vs Monza)
    - Track-specific DNF rates
  - **Driver-specific priors**: Individual performance history
    - Experience-based adjustments (rookie vs veteran)
    - Personal scoring rates and reliability
  - **Hierarchical model**: Weighted combination of all levels
    - Global (20%), Track (20%), Team (40%), Driver (20%)
    - Dynamic confidence based on data availability

- Updated `f1_predictions_enhanced_v3.py`:
  - Integrated hierarchical priors into all predictions
  - Pass driver, constructor, and circuit IDs to calibration
  - Experience adjustment factor (0.8-1.2 based on races)
  - Inverse adjustment for DNF (experienced = lower DNF)

### Key Features
- **Smart weighting**: Team gets highest weight (40%) as it's most predictive
