## üìÅ Structure

### Root Level - Original Workshop Notebooks
- **Clicked_Formula_1_EDA.ipynb** - Exploratory Data Analysis
- **Clicked_Formula_1_Feature_Engineering_and_Modeling.ipynb** - Initial ML models

### advanced/ - Production-Ready Solutions
- **F1_Core_Models.ipynb** - Fixed overfitting, proper temporal validation with Random Forest and Gradient Boosting
- **F1_Constructor_Driver_Evaluation.ipynb** - Driver evaluation system for teams
- **F1_Betting_Market_Models.ipynb** - Betting market predictions
- **Random_Forest_and_Gradient_Boosting.ipynb** - Ensemble methods exploration

## üéØ Learning Path

1. **Start with** the "Clicked" notebooks to understand the basics
2. **Then explore** the advanced notebooks for production-ready solutions

## üìä Notebook Descriptions

### Original Workshop Series
